    "#### 14. Local Behavior of an Analytic Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem** $\\text{ }$ The modulus of an analytic function $f(z)$ cannot have a local maximum within the region of analyticity of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "**proof** $\\text{ }$ Consider an arbitrary regular point $z_0$ of $f(z)$. Then provided $r$ is small enough, $f(z)$ is analytic within and on a circle $\\Gamma$ of radius $r$ centered at $z=z_0$. According to the Cauchy integral formula, one has\n",

    ">$\\displaystyle f(z)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_\\Gamma \\frac{f(z)}{z -z_0}\\,dz$\n",

    "Using the Darboux inequality, we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\displaystyle \\left| f(z_0) \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\mathrm{max} \\left| \\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} \\right|_{z \\in \\Gamma} \\cdot 2\\pi r=\\mathrm{max} |f(z)|_{z \\in \\Gamma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since one may choose $r$ arbitrarily small, in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of $z_0$, there always exists at least one point where\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\displaystyle |f(z)| \\geq |f(z_0)|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $|f(z)|$ cannot have a local maximum at $z_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a regular point $z=z_0$ such that $f(z_0)\\neq 0$, $1/f(z)$ is an analytic function of $z$. Therefore, $1/|f(z)|$ cannot have a maximum at $z=z_0$ and so $|f(z)|$ cannot have a minimum at this point\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogous result holds for the real and imaginary parts of an analytic fucntion $f(z)$. Applying the preceding theorem to the functions $e^{f(z)}$ and $e^{-i f(z)}$, we find that neither\n",
