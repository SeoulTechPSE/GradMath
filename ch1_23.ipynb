    "* Until now we have considered contour integrals of functions in two different cases. In the first case, the integral was along a curve inside, or on which there were no singularities of the function; this led us to **Cauchy's theorem**. In the second case, the boundary curve enclosed, but did not go through, singularities of the function, and this led us to the **theorem of residues**\n",

The explicit forms of the functions $\\Delta_j$ can be found using the methods of calculus of residues and Jordan's lemma. Consider the function $\\Delta_1(t)$.
