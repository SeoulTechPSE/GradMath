    "* Until now we have considered contour integrals of functions in two different cases. In the first case, the integral was along a curve inside, or on which there were no singularities of the function; this led us to **Cauchy's theorem**. In the second case, the boundary curve enclosed, but did not go through, singularities of the function, and this led us to the **theorem of residues**\n",

    "* There remains to consider the case when the path of integration actually passes **through** a singularity of the integrand. We shall show that the result of the integration will then depend on how the path is chosen to avoid the singularity\n",
