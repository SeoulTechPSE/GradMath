The function $\\ln z$ changes continuously as we follow $\\mathrm{C}$, but after the completion of a full cycle, $\\ln z_0$ will have increased by $2\\pi i$, since $\\arg z$ will have increased by $2\\pi$\n",

    "A point of the complex plane having the property that, after the completion of any circle around it, a given function is not restored to its initial value is called a **branch point** of the function.

By considering the behavior of the function $f(1/z')=\\ln(1/z')$ at $z'=0$, we find similarly that *the point at infinity* is also a branch point of $\\ln z$.\n",

In that case, the integral is independent of the path because two paths that do not cross the cut cannot enclose the only singularity of the integrand located at the origin. But we have already shown that the integral $\\int_a^z f(z')\\,dz'$ is an analytic function of $z$ in regions where it does not depend on the path connecting $a$ and $z$. Hence $g(z)$ is analytic in the cut $z$ plane.\n",

    "\n",
    "The contradiction brought about by the existence of branch points has been removed, although somewhat artificially, for any of the functions $f_n(z)$, since it is now no longer possible to encircle a branch point without crossing the cut\n",

    "This suggests the following geometrical construction: We superpose an infinite series of cut complex planes one on top of the other, each plane corresponding to a different value of $n$ ($=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2,\\cdots$). The adjacent planes are connected along the cut; the upper lip of the cut in the $n$-th plane is connected to the lower lip of the cut in the $(n+1)$st plane. Hence, a crossing of the cut is equivalent to going to one of the two adjacent complex plane\n",
