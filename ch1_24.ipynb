In that case, the integral is independent of the path because two paths that do not cross the cut cannot enclose the only singularity of the integrand located at the origin. But we have already shown that the integral $\\int_a^z f(z')\\,dz'$ is an analytic function of $z$ in regions where it does not depend on the path connecting $a$ and $z$.

The adjacent planes are connected along the cut; the upper lip of the cut in the $n$-th plane is connected to the lower lip of the cut in the $(n+1)$st plane.

From a sequence of single-valued functions defined in a **single** complex plain, we have obtained one continuous single-valued function defined on a Riemann surface. In fact, throughout the Riemann surface we have just constructed, the logarithmic function is analytic at the branch points, which play the role of singular points\n",

Otherwise, a branch point is said to be of an infinite order, as is the case for the two branch points of the logarithmic function; by performing successive rotations around the origin, we move farther and farther away from the initial Riemann sheet"
